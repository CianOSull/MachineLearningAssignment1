# MachineLearningAssignment1
 Machine Leanring Module Assignment 1 to create a Bayesian Classificaiton function for creating a model that can decide if a movie review is positive or negative.

MachineLearningAssignmentClassifier.py is the file that was submitted.

## Project specifiction:<br />
**Objective**:<br />
The Excel file “movie_reviews.xlsx” on Canvas contains movie reviews from IMDb along with 
their associated binary sentiment polarity labels (“positive” or ”negative”) and a split 
indicator to determine if you are supposed to use the corresponding review for training your 
classifier (“train”) or for the evaluation (“test”).<br />
<br />
The goal of this assignment is to create and evaluate a Naïve Bayesian classifier that can 
read a movie review and decide, if the review author would rate the movie as positive or 
negative based on the text entered.<br />
